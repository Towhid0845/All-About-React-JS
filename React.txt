🔥 create a React application 🔥
--------------------------------
    1️⃣ npx create-react-app xyz-app
    2️⃣ cd xyz-app    
    3️⃣ npm start


🔥 File Structure of React 🔥
-----------------------------
    App.js ➡️ index.js ➡️ index.html
    
    ✅ App.js is a component. This is the actual file where we write all our code. 
        We export it in index.js(or other js file)

    ✅ index.js is works as a medium. 
        It imports the App.js file and render it in the index.html file using an id.

    ✅ index.html is the reason for that we see the project in web browser.


🔥 Babel 🔥
-----------
    ✅ babel is a JavaScript compiler
    ✅ it wrap's the code for us.
    ✅ It is automatically installed in React when we create a react app.
    ❤️ Example:                            
                code for user               |            code for browser
                -------------               |            ----------------
                                            |    "use strict";
        const towhid = 'web developer';     |    var towhid = 'web developer';
        const myapp = () = {                |    var myapp = function() {
            console.log('Hello Towhid');    |        console.log('Hello Towhid');
        }                                   |    }


🔥 JSX (JavaScript XML) 🔥
--------------------------
    ✅ It allow us to write JavaScript and HTML code together. 
    ✅ It always return a single element. You must need to wrap all the code within a sigle tag.
    ✅ It is better to use <></> (syntactic sugar format of <React.Fragment>) as wrapper tag.
    ✅ You need to close all non-closing tag.
    ✅ You must use two-words attribute in camelCase. e.g. onClick={} (but normaly onclick()) or use single word normally.
    ✅ We need to write 'className' instead of 'class' because it is an attribute.
    🗄️ See the detail in 📁Basic > 📁myapp > 📁src > index.js > at point 5

    ❤️ Example
        ReactDOM.render(<h1>Hello Towhid</h1>, document.getElementById("root"));
                        ---------------------
                                 ⬇️            
                            This is JSX 


🔥 React Fragment 🔥
--------------------
    ✅ the JSX code should wrap within a single tag called <React.Fragment></React.Fragment>
    ✅ simplest form of React Fragment is <></>
    🗄️ See the detail in 📁Basic > 📁myapp > 📁src > index.js > at point 4


🔥 Component 🔥
---------------
    ✅ At first, it is better to add 'import React from "react"'
    ✅ At least, one function (functional Component) need to add in that component.
    ✅ Functon name should be Capitalized.
    ✅ You must return something (JSX).





----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


🌟 ReactDOM.render()
    It controls the contents of the container node you pass in.
    It currently returns a referance to the root ReactComponent instance.

🌟 React Hook
    ✅ write it before a function return.


🌟 useState Hook
    ✅ It takes a single parameter as initial data.
    ✅ It is used to manage data.
    ✅ It returns an array of two elements(first: state variable & second: updated function).


🌟 how to access input feild data in JS❓
    ✅ use 'value' and 'onChange' attribute to access it.

🌟 Math Functons 🌟
--------------------
    ✅ variable_name.toFixed(number): how many number you want after decimal point.
