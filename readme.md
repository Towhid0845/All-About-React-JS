## What is React?
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces and it is all about components.

## create a React application 🔥
``` code
npx create-react-app xyz-app
cd xyz-app 
npm start
```

## File Structure of React 🔥
App.js ➡️ index.js ➡️ index.html
- App.js is a component. This is the actual file where we write all our code. We export it in index.js(or other js file)
- index.js is works as a medium. It imports the App.js file and render it in the index.html file using an id.
- index.html is the reason for that we see the project in web browser.


## Babel 🔥
- babel is a JavaScript compiler
- it wrap's the code for us.
- It is automatically installed in React when we create a react app.

Example ❤️                          
|code for user|code for browser|
|-------------|----------------|
|"use strict";| |
|const towhid = 'web developer';|var towhid = 'web developer';|
|const myapp = () = {|var myapp = function() {|
|console.log('Hello Towhid');|console.log('Hello Towhid');|
|}|}|

## JSX (JavaScript XML) 🔥
- It allow us to write JavaScript and HTML code together. 
- It always return a single element. You must need to wrap all the code within a single tag.
- It is better to use <></> (syntactic sugar format of <React.Fragment>) as wrapper tag.
- You need to close all non-closing tag.
- You must use two-words attribute in camelCase. e.g. onClick={} (but normally onclick()) or use single word normally.
- We need to write 'className' instead of 'class' because it is an attribute.

📓 See the detail in 📁learn > 📁src > index.js > at point 5

Example ❤️
```code
ReactDOM.render(<h1>Hello Towhid</h1>, document.getElementById("root"));
                ---------------------
                            ⬇️            
                        This is JSX 
```
## React Fragment 🔥
-  the JSX code should wrap within a single tag called `<React.Fragment></React.Fragment>`
-  simplest form of React Fragment is <></>

📓 See the detail in 📁learn > 📁src > index.js > at point 4

## Component 🔥
- At first, it is better to add 'import React from "react"'
- At least, one function (functional Component) need to add in that component.
- Function name should be Capitalized.
- You must return something (JSX).

## React Developer Tools 🔥
- It is a browser(chrome, mozilla, safari, edge) extension for React.
- We use it to know what components are used in a React application.

## ReactDOM.render() 🔥
It controls the contents of the container node you pass in. It currently returns a reference to the root ReactComponent instance.

## React Hook 🔥
- It allows you to use state and other React features without writing a class.
- Hooks are the functions which "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components.
- It does not work inside classes.
- Write it at the top of a functional component(before the function return).
- Hook can not run under any condition

## useState Hook 🔥
- It is used to manage data.
- It takes a single parameter as initial data.
- It returns an array of two elements(first: state variable & second: updated function).

Example ❤️
`const [currentValue, setCurrentValue] = useState(initialValue)`
Here, initially currentValue = initialValue;
when update_function(setCurrentValue) is updated, currentValue = updated_Value

## key prop in map method 🔥
- Keys help React identify which items have changed (added/removed/re-ordered).
- To give a unique identity to every element inside the array, a key is required.
- When we use map() method to extract a list (every child of the list must contain a unique value), we always use a key prop.
